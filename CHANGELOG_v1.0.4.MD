1. Data Collection Enhancements

    Patient Class Modifications:
        Added arrival_time to track when each patient arrives.
        Introduced a timestamps dictionary in each Patient instance to record the time of each event (e.g., start and end times of registration, triage, treatment).
    Hospital Class Modifications:
        Added a patients list to store all Patient objects for later analysis.
        Added a resource_log list to collect resource utilization data over time.
        Implemented a collect_resource_utilization method to record the utilization of each resource at every time step.
    Patient Process Modifications:
        At each step (registration, triage, diagnostics, surgery, treatment, recovery), we record:
            Wait Times: Time the patient spent waiting before accessing a resource.
            Start and End Times: When the process started and ended.
        At the end of the process, we append the patient to hospital.patients for data analysis.

2. Performance Metrics Calculation

    Dataframe Creation:
        Converted the list of patient data into a Pandas DataFrame (df_patients), facilitating data manipulation and analysis.
    KPIs:
        Calculated the average total time patients spend in the system.
        Computed average waiting times and service times for each process step.
        Calculated average resource utilization over the simulation period.

3. Bottleneck Identification

    Identified bottlenecks by analyzing the maximum wait times in each process.
    This helps in pinpointing where patients experience the longest delays.

4. Statistical Reports and Visualizations

    Resource Utilization Over Time:
        Plotted resource utilization for doctors, nurses, and beds over time.

    Distribution of Total Time in System:
        Created a histogram to visualize the distribution of total time patients spend in the system.

    Additional Plots:
        You can add more plots, such as bar charts for average wait times per patient type or severity level.

5. Importing Necessary Libraries

    Added imports for pandas and matplotlib.pyplot for data analysis and visualization:

    python

    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

6. Analysis Function

    Created an analyze_data function that encapsulates all data analysis and reporting.
    Called this function at the end of the main function after the simulation run.

Interpreting the Results
•	Average Waiting Times: High average waiting times in a particular process may indicate a need for more resources in that area.
•	Resource Utilization: Resources with consistently high utilization (close to 100%) may become bottlenecks.
•	Bottleneck Analysis: Maximum wait times help identify extreme cases where patients experience significant delays.
•	Visualizations: Provide a visual understanding of how resources are used and how patients flow through the system.
